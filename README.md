# dice-by-flutter19
a repository where we make 2 dices and when you click on them random numbers get generated. This is made with the help of a flutter course by Angela Yu.
only the main code is uploaded , the 5 images used in this have to be downloaded in the assets folder by the user itself, Nothing other than that is required.
